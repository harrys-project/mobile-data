               <p>(KNOXVILLE) Months after two terrorists killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., the FBI is demanding Apple help them unlock one of the phones used by the attackers.&nbsp;</p><p>A federal magistrate judge ordered Apple on Tuesday to create software&nbsp;that would disable the security feature that erases data from the iPhone after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it.</p><p>It&#39;s a privacy versus security issue that&#39;s affecting the nation down to a local level.</p><p>&ldquo;We could unlock iPhones for a while, so we did have phones that were iPhones that we unlocked that we used in cases,&quot; Knox County District Attorney General Charme Allen said. &quot;But since Apple has done this, we do have a collection of phones starting at law enforcement that we have seized that are sitting there that we cannot get into, so it has become an issue.&rdquo;</p><p>The phones now idle are held in cases involving crimes against children, according to Allen.</p><p>Allen said phone data is key in solving many crimes, especially in child abuse, drug- or gun-related cases.</p><p>&ldquo;As a district attorney, my charge is to keep folks safe,&quot; she said. &quot;Anything that I can do to keep folks safer is what I&rsquo;m going to pursue. When there&rsquo;s information inside a phone that helps us solve a crime, that helps us prevent a crime, that helps us prosecute a crime, I&rsquo;m going to go after that and want that information.&rdquo;</p><p>Although she said access to phones is key, critics believe the FBI-Apple case is putting the average phone user&#39;s information at serious risk.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly there is a good interest in getting into this phone, particularly in San Bernardino,&quot; attorney Don Bosch said. &quot;But the question is what about the next time? That may not be as good of a reason or as legitimate as a security interest as it might outweigh privacy concerns?&quot;</p><p>Bosch said if Apple does provide the requested technical assistance, history could repeat itself in a negative way.</p><p>&quot;While the FBI is claiming this is just one phone they want to look into, they need the proprietary information that Apple possesses to encrypt their phones,&quot; he said. &quot;Once they possess it, they&rsquo;re in a better position to use it or not, and unfortunately in our history, we&rsquo;ve had far too many cases of law enforcement and abuses that have later been found to be inappropriate.&rdquo;</p><p>Allen said it takes work to access a person&#39;s phone.</p><p>&ldquo;To get into a person&rsquo;s phone, I have to have a search warrant,&quot; she said. &quot;Law enforcement can&rsquo;t just go through anybody&rsquo;s phone and invade your privacy for no reason. We don&rsquo;t even get to the point to need to go into the phone until we can link it to a particular crime, so if there&rsquo;s no criminal activity involved, we would never go into your phone.&rdquo;</p><p>She also said if Apple makes the software, and it happens to get in the wrong hands down the road, law enforcement is there to help.</p><p>&ldquo;If your rights are really violated and someone gets into your phone that doesn&rsquo;t need to be in your phone, whether it&rsquo;s the government or it&#39;s your next door neighbor,&quot; she said. &quot;If it&rsquo;s a crime, then we will prosecute that as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Apple said late Tuesday <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/16/apple-san-bernardino-iphone-magistrate-order/80478844/">it would oppose the ruling</a>.&nbsp;</p>
