                            <p >COLUMBIA, S.C. &mdash;&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Hillary>Hillary Clinton&nbsp;has picked up her biggest win yet over&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Bernie>Sen. Bernie Sanders&nbsp;in the 2016 Democratic presidential race, winning Saturday&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/South>South Carolina primary. Her win in the Palmetto State, where African-Americans made up a large percentage of the electorate, gives Clinton a boost heading into&nbsp;Tuesday, when a number&nbsp;of states with large black populations&nbsp;cast their votes.</p><p >Clinton&#39;s win is her third of the campaign. A week ago, she captured the Nevada caucuses and won the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses by a razor-thin margin.</p><p ><a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Bracing">Bracing&nbsp;for the loss,&nbsp;Sanders has been&nbsp;hitting&nbsp;Clinton&nbsp;on issues important to African Americans, including criminal-justice reform. With merely&nbsp;days before&nbsp;larger, delegate-rich states like Texas and Georgia&nbsp;vote on March 1, the Vermont senator&nbsp;needs&nbsp;to expand his support among minorities.</p><p >Early exit surveys show&nbsp;why South Carolina&nbsp;is the first real test of the candidates&#39; appeal to black voters. Six in ten South Carolina Democratic primary voters were African-American, the early polls indicated, which may break the state&#39;s 55% record from 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama was on the ballot.&nbsp;In contrast to Iowa and New Hampshire, many more South Carolina voters also consider themselves moderates looking for a candidate with experience in politics versus an &quot;outsider.&quot; In another positive sign for Clinton, more voters think she is honest than say so about Sanders.</p><p >A sizable victory&nbsp;Saturday could set Clinton on a glide path to winning a series of southern states, where polls show she&#39;s favored. Obama&#39;s big margin of victory in South Carolina was critical in putting him on a path to the nomination.</p><p >Yet Sanders will press forward despite the expected losses. His campaign sees an opportunity in states including Massachusetts and Oklahoma, with its&nbsp;large percentage of independent voters, as well as Colorado and Minnesota, both caucus states that come later in March. Sanders&nbsp;is also still flush with campaign cash, pulling in millions of dollars in new contributions after his decisive win&nbsp;in New Hampshire. And, even if loses the nomination, amassing a significant number of&nbsp;delegates would empower him to elevate the issues he cares about most, such as campaign finance reform, at the July&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Democratic>Democratic convention&nbsp;in Cleveland.</p><p >In the past couple of days, the senator has taken a more&nbsp;critical tone. At a rally in<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Orangeburg">Orangeburg, he gave an abbreviated version of his stump speech before attacking Clinton&rsquo;s support for the death penalty as well as 1990s-era welfare reform &mdash; emotionally charged topics in African-American communities.</p><p >&ldquo;Let me throw it out,&rdquo; Sanders said. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think the government should be involved in that violence and should be killing people,&rdquo; he said, stating that Clinton disagrees. He also cited the fact that a lot of innocent &ldquo;people of color&rdquo; have been executed.</p><p >He then&nbsp;made a hard pivot from talking about Republican&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Donald>Donald <a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Donald>Trump&ldquo;scapegoating minorities&rdquo; to discussing a 1996 welfare overhaul that, he said, assumed &ldquo;poor people were ripping off the system.&rdquo;</p><p >The &ldquo;end result&rdquo; was a doubling of extreme poverty rates, Sanders told the crowd gathered in Orangeburg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about the poorest of the poor, children who are hungry,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I vigorously opposed that legislation&rdquo; while &ldquo;Secretary Clinton supported it,&rdquo; he said.</p><p >On Saturday morning in Texas, he slammed Clinton for supporting the 1996&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Defense>Defense of Marriage Act, calling it &ldquo;homophobic.&rdquo;</p><p >Later, Sanders senior adviser&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Tad>Tad Devine&nbsp;made a more direct link between Clinton and Trump, tweeting a link to a&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>&nbsp;story: &ldquo;What Trump and Clinton have in common: A resistance to transparency.&rdquo;</p><p >The broadsides were a continuation of a speech the night before in Chicago. Yet it appears the Vermont senator may be conflicted over the approach. In his final appearance in South Carolina on Friday night,&nbsp;Sanders dropped the attacks and stuck largely to his stump speech before a large crowd in Columbia.</p><p >Yet Clinton campaign officials worry that the more aggressive posture, mostly on policies enacted under her husband&rsquo;s administration &mdash; and not legislation she championed as a U.S. senator &ndash; encourages a divisive tone that could linger into the general election.</p><p >The Sanders campaign says it&rsquo;s merely drawing distinctions between the two candidates, which is different from a personal attack.</p><p >Spokesman Michael Briggs said that the Vermont senator believes &quot;it is important for voters to know and understand the differences between Sen. Sanders &nbsp;and Secretary Clinton on a host of issues like taking on Wall Street, Big Oil, the pharmaceutical industry and the rest of the rigged economy.&quot;</p><p >South Carolina state Rep.&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Justin>Justin Bamberg, a Sanders backer, argued that drawing distinctions is &quot;important&quot; and that it wasn&#39;t personal.&nbsp;He argued&nbsp;that Sanders is the most electable candidate. &ldquo;It may be too late in South Carolina for that message to resonate,&rdquo; but not for the rest of the country, said Bamberg.</p><p >However, the Clinton campaign believes the new approach is the sort of negative rhetoric&nbsp;that Sanders swore off earlier in the campaign. As recently as the end of last month, Sanders said he would resist the pressure to personally attack Clinton and would run a positive campaign &ldquo;because I think it is the moral and right thing to do.&rdquo;</p><p >During the Chicago&nbsp;address on Thursday, Sanders&rsquo; attacks on Clinton were wide-ranging, from her Wall Street speaking fees and contributions to policies enacted under her husband&rsquo;s administration, including welfare reform, trade policy and an anti-gay rights bill.</p><p >In a Thursday press release, Sanders campaign manager&nbsp;<a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Jeff>Jeff <a href="http://curiyo.com/en/topic/Jeff>Weaverhighlighted&nbsp;Clinton&rsquo;s support for a 1994 crime bill that&rsquo;s blamed for high incarceration rates of young African-American men. Clinton has called for new legislation to undo the laws, and Sanders voted for the same bill while expressing criticism.</p><p >&ldquo;Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, resorted to dog whistle politics and dehumanizing language,&rdquo; said Weaver.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>
