                     <p>Raise your hand if you use your phone to text. Most people who read this story will text several if not dozens of times today. It&rsquo;s how we keep in contact with friends, family and co-workers. These days we can even order food by texting in our orders.</p><p>So what is the one number we can&rsquo;t text in Arizona, the one we won&rsquo;t get a response? It might surprise to learn it&rsquo;s maybe the most important of all, 911.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very frustrating,&rdquo; Terri Guy said.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re wondering when you may need to text 911 instead of just calling there are certainly more than a few situations. A robber or rapist breaks into your home, you&rsquo;re hiding from an abusive partner or maybe you&rsquo;re trapped in a house fire overcome by smoke.</p><p>One of those scenarios almost played out in Scottsdale last year. It was probably the most terrifying moment a 12-year-old boy has ever been through. He was home when two men tried to break into his home. The boy called 911 telling the operator what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two strange men on my back porch and I think they&rsquo;re trying to open the door,&rdquo; the boy said.</p><p>The men never got inside, the boy hiding in the closet whispering to the dispatcher. Had the men got inside that boy would not want to talk and could not text his location or information.</p><p>&ldquo;There are certainly situations you can&rsquo;t talk and need to text,&rdquo; Tim Guy said.</p><p>The lack of 911 text service almost cost Guy his life. His wife, who is severely hearing impaired can&rsquo;t call 911. Last year Guy suffered a heart attack in their home and fortunately he knew the signs so Terri was able to rush him to the hospital</p><p>&ldquo;I tried to call before and no one understands what I&rsquo;m saying,&rdquo; his wife Terri Guy said.</p><p>That&rsquo;s part of the reason Teri is part of a class action lawsuit against the state of Arizona seeking direct access to 911 services through text.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to have something, a back safety in place,&rdquo; Terri said.</p><p>The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the implementation of the text 911 system in the state of Arizona. The suit represents thousands of residents in Arizona.</p>
