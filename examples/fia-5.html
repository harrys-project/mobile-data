                     <p>TEMPE, Ariz. - Boaters, rowers and fishers were no longer allowed on Tempe Town Lake Wednesday morning as crews prepared to start the draining process of the 800 million gallons of water in the lake.</p><p>The closure will last a couple of months as crews start the next phase of work to switch from the current inflated rubber dam -- in use for more than 15 years -- to a concrete-and-steel dam, which officials say should last at least 50 years.</p><p>Areas surrounding the lake, including the pedestrian bridge and parks, will stay open through the project.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a popular spot for people who enjoy the fresh air and getting exercise outdoors.</p><p>Kellie Bochart walks her dog across the lake every day. She says she will have to change her route once the water is gone.</p><p>&ldquo;[The water] attracts wildlife,&rdquo; said Bochart. &ldquo;My dog is really into chasing all the animals around. I personally enjoy being by the water every day. I&rsquo;d probably go somewhere else that did have water, especially if it&rsquo;s going to be gone so long.&rdquo;</p><p>The entire project will cost Tempe more than $45 million.</p><p>The crews will pump the water into pipes underneath Loop 202 just north of the lake. The water will eventually end up in SRP&rsquo;s Grand Canal.</p><p>The city hired experts to remove fish from the lake bed and pools of water as it is emptied.</p><p>The lake it expected to open again by the end of April.</p>
