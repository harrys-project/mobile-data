                     <p>Six women filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday claiming the University of Tennessee has created a student culture&nbsp;that enables&nbsp;sexual assaults by student athletes, especially football players, and then uses an unusual, legalistic adjudication process that is biased against victims who step forward.</p><p>The lawsuit, as reported by the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/02/09/sweeping-sexual-assault-suit-filed-against-ut/79966450/">Tennessean</a>&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;</em>filed by plaintiffs identified only as &quot;Jane Does&quot;, accuses&nbsp;five Tennessee athletes of sexual assault. They are former basketball player&nbsp;Yemi Makanjuola, former football players A.J. Johnson, Michael Williams, Riyahd Jones and a current football player named as a &quot;John Doe.&quot;</p><p><strong>PREVIOUS</strong>: <a href="http://legacy.wbir.com/story/sports/college/vols/2014/11/17/2-ut-students-accused-of-rape-and-sexual-assualt/19166681/">Johnson, Williams accused of rape</a></p><p><strong>RELATED</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="http://legacy.wbir.com/story/news/crime/2015/08/24/trial-starts--former-ut-football-player-accused--rape/32252725/">Rape trials for former UT football players delayed</a></p><p>The lawsuit also details an incident involving a female student who was sexually assaulted by&nbsp;a non-athlete, who was named a John Doe. The alleged assault took place&nbsp;after attending a football team party at Vol Hall, a campus dorm where she was served drinks by former UT player Traevon Paulk, the lawsuit says.</p><p>In making its case that the university enabled an environment of&nbsp;bad behavior and used a&nbsp;disciplinary&nbsp;system that favored the&nbsp;players, the lawsuit cited more than a dozen incidents involving football players that included underage drinking, sexual harassment, assault, armed robbery and sexual assaults that did not involve the Jane Doe plaintiffs. Some of the incidents cited have previously never been reported.</p><p>The plaintiffs claim that UT violated the Title IX laws, which protect students from gender discrimination. UT created&nbsp;a hostile sexual environment for female students by showing &ldquo;deliberate indifference and a clearly unreasonable response after a sexual assault that causes a student to endure additional harassment,&quot; according to the lawsuit.</p><p><strong>READ</strong>: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/298786145/Jane-Does-vs-UT">Federal lawsuit filed against UT</a></p><p>The lawsuit said blame for the hostile policies should be placed at the very top of the UT administration.</p><p>&ldquo;UT administration (Chancellor Jimmy Cheek), athletic department (Vice Chancellor and Athletics Director) Dave Hart&nbsp;and football coach (Butch Jones) were personally aware (as &lsquo;appropriate persons&rsquo; under Title IX) and had actual notice of previous sexual assaults and rapes by football players, yet acted with deliberate indifference to the serious risks of sexual assaults and failed to take corrective actions,&rdquo; the plaintiffs said in their lawsuit.</p><p>The plaintiffs claim that UT&rsquo;s administrative hearing process, which is utilized by public universities across the state, is unfair because it provides students accused of sexual assault the right to attorneys and to confront their accusers through cross examination and an evidentiary hearing in front of an administrative law judge. The administrative law judge that hears the case is appointed by Chancellor Jimmy Cheek, the lawsuit says.</p><p>The university &quot;delayed the investigation process until the athlete perpetrators transferred to another school or graduated without saction or discipline,&quot; the lawsuit said.</p><p><b>To read more, head to <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/02/09/sweeping-sexual-assault-suit-filed-against-ut/79966450/">Tennessean.com.</a></b></p><p>The University of Tennessee released the following statement from&nbsp;Bill Ramsey, Counsel for the University of Tennessee, in response to the lawsuit:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Like the many other college campuses facing the challenges of sexual assault, the&nbsp;University of Tennessee, Knoxville, has devoted significant time and energy to provide a safe&nbsp;environment for our students, to educate and raise awareness about sexual assault, and to&nbsp;encourage students to come forward and report sexual assault. When the University receives a&nbsp;report of sexual assault, we offer care and support to the person who came forward and work to&nbsp;investigate and resolve the matter in a timely, thorough, and equitable manner. When warranted,&nbsp;the University takes disciplinary action but will not do so in a manner that violates state law or<br / >
the constitutional due process rights of our students.<br / >
<br / >
In the situations identified in the lawsuit filed today; the University acted lawfully and in&nbsp;good faith, and we expect a court to agree. Any assertion that we do not take sexual assault&nbsp;seriously enough is simply not true. To claim that we have allowed a culture to exist contrary to&nbsp;our institutional commitment to providing a safe environment for our students or that we do not&nbsp;support those who report sexual assault is just false. The University will provide a detailed&nbsp;response to the lawsuit and looks forward to doing so at the appropriate time, and in the proper&nbsp;manner.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p ><a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/298786145/Jane-Does-vs-UT">Jane Does vs UT</a></p><p><iframe ></iframe></p>
