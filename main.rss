<![CDATA[<p>PERQUIMANS COUNTY, N.C. (WVEC) -- A mother of two in Snug Harbor died Wednesday after her dog mauled her inside her home.</p><p>Perquimans County Sheriff Eric Tilley said the attack happened around 1 p.m. in the 1200 block of Snug Harbor Road.</p><p>Suzanne Story, 36, died just as a medical crew from Norfolk landed to take her to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.</p><p>Story&#39;s family told 13News Now she got the female Pit Bull from Virginia about a week ago after she saw an advertisement in a newspaper. The ad said the dog was good with small children.</p><p>&quot;I think they had a problem with the dog and didn&#39;t know how to handle it, and they were just trying to get rid of it, and they did,&quot; said Story&#39;s stepfather, Randy Brown. &quot;Found somebody that would take it, and ended up with a death.&quot;</p><p>Brown added that the people who had the dog gave her to Story at no charge.</p><p>&quot;Brought the dog down here, and said that the dog was gentle, it was good with people, good with children, it had never attacked any person,&quot; Brown stated. &quot;Why a dog would attack her, I mean, is beyond me, but it had to have been the dog, not her.&quot;</p><p>Story&#39;s mother, Debbie Brown, said Story was cleaning the dog&#39;s crate at the time of the attack.</p><p>Story&#39;s sister was there and tried to stop it but could not.
